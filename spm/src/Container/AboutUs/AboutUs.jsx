        <h1>History</h1>
        <p style={{fontSize:'20px', color:'white'}}>Founded in 1972, began as a small
           venture with a big dream: to bring the rich flavors of authentic spices to kitchens around the world.
            What started as a humble shop in Kandy has grown into a trusted name known for quality, freshness,
             and exceptional service. Over the years, we have stayed true to our roots, carefully sourcing premium 
             spices like cardamom, cloves, and pepper from the finest growers. As we expanded, we embraced modern
              technology to offer convenient services such as home delivery, online ordering, and customizable
               gift packs. Today, [Your Company Name] continues to honor its legacy by delivering not just spices,
                but memories and traditions that connect families and communities. We are proud of how far weâ€™ve 
                come and excited about what the future holds</p>
